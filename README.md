# Deep-Learning-Framework-for-Cardiovascular-Disease-Classification


## Overview
This project is at the forefront of utilizing advanced data processing and machine learning techniques to predict the occurrence of heart strokes with
remarkable accuracy. Our team has meticulously segmented the project into four integral modules, focusing on data collection, organization, analysis, and
the application of sophisticated Machine Learning models such as the Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPC) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA).
This endeavor has led us to achieve a groundbreaking prediction accuracy rate of 97%.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your machine. Clone the project and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourproject/heart-stroke-prediction.git
cd heart-stroke-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the prediction model, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
python stroke_prediction.py --data your_data.csv
```

Replace `your_data.csv` with the path to your dataset. For detailed usage instructions, including available command line options, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Data

The initial dataset comprises details and lifestyle factors of over 100 individuals, leading to more than 1,000 records. While the dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy concerns, 
we provide guidelines on structuring your dataset for compatibility with our models.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all forms. Here's how you can help:
